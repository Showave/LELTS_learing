I'd like to find out if you have excurisons suitable for families.
Sure how about taking your family for a cruise.
we have a steamship that takes passengers out severa times a day -it's over 100years old.
That sounds interesting .how long is the trip ?
About an hour and  a half .
And don't forget to take pictures of the mountains.
they're all around you when you're on the boat and they look fantastic .
Ok,and I assume there's a coffee or something on board .
How old your children .
My daughter is fifteen and my son is seven .
Right ,well there various things you can do  once you're crossed  the lake ,to make  a day of it .
